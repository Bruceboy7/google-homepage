This is my first attempt at copying an existing page using the skills i have learned through the Odin Project. We'll see how this goes!

UPDATE: I'm SO INSPIRED! Initially, getting the top navigation bar to be at the top was its own struggle, and tbh, same with the footer. Also, i learned so much about the :hover feature with this excercise. It was a great review of all that the odin project had me work through (especially the freecodecamp lessons). 
-still unsure if i was supposed to be able to make the google apps dropdown window with what i already knew, but everything else, i'm very proud of!
